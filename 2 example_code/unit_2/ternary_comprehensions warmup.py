'''Expected output with original code:
Original passing scores: [88, 92, 95, 83, 91, 82]
Adjusted scores: [90, 94, 77, 97, 85, 79, 93, 84]
Grade result: B
Class status: Excellent class performance
'''
# After transformation, the code should look like:
passing = [score for score in scores if score >= 80]
adjusted = [score + 2 for score in scores]
result = "A" if score >= 90 else "B"
status = "Excellent class performance" if len(passing) > 5 else "Need review session"
