    "## What is Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It was created by John Hunter in 2003 and is designed to be as usable as MATLAB with the advantage of being free and open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library consists of several modules, but the most commonly used is `pyplot`, which provides a simple interface for creating plots. We'll focus on this interface in the first part of our tutorial."

    "1. **File not found**: Make sure the path to your data file is correct.\n",

    "3. **Unequal array lengths**: When creating a plot, make sure your x and y arrays have the same length.\n",
    "4. **Plot not showing**: Make sure to call `plt.show()` at the end of your plotting code.\n",
    "5. **Missing labels**: Don't forget to add axis labels and titles for clarity.\n",
    "6. **Cut-off elements**: If parts of your plot (like axis labels or titles) are cut off, use `plt.tight_layout()` to adjust the plot layout.\n",
